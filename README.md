# Power Down Alarm

Is a super simple program that just checks how long it was of.

The motivation for this is that my building has continuous power outages
and I just wanted something that I could keep running on my RasberryPI to
automatically track the power outages.

This was put together very quickly and is not an elegant solution.

TODO:

- Truncate file automatically
- Better handling of errors
- Email/push notifications when the power comes back
- Auto uploading CSV to cloud storage
